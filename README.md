Drum-Kit is designed to play sounds and add visual effects to elements on a webpage when specific keys are pressed.
When a key is pressed, the corresponding sound plays and a visual effect is added to the key element. The visual effect is removed once the transition ends.
The script uses event listeners to trigger functions based on key presses and transitions.
